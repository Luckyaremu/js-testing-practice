# tdd-practice

## Description

[Odin] TDD (Test Driven Development) practice using Jest.

This repository contains multiple functions separated each within its folder containing two files: the module `function.js` and a Jest test file `function.test.js`.

The main idea is simply to start working on your code by writing automated tests before writing the code that is being tested.

### Libraries, extensions and tools

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript Testing Framework
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript transpiler
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter tool to standardize code
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
